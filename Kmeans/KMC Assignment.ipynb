    "In this Assignment you will be implementing K Means from scratch on your own. If you have gone through the theory material, you will have implemented K Means using scikit learn. However to get a better understanding of what is actually happening behind the scenes, you will be implementing K Means from scratch.\n",

    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "In this Assignment you will be scored solely on the correctness and efficiency of your implementation.\n",

    "<b>You are not allowed to use any library other than numpy and matplotlib (You can use seaborn instead of matplotlib if you wish to do so).</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find many implementations of K Means from scratch online but please refrain from looking into those and try implementing on your own just using the theory that you know.\n",
