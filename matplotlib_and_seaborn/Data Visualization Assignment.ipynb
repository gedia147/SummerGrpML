    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Truthfulness (5)</b>: This section is the easiest to score. We'll take a look at your data cleaning process and make sure that you have not tampered with any data (like manually filling null values if exists). If all the methods used in the cleaning process are logically correct and the assumptions you have made (if any) are sensible, you'll get full points.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Beauty (5)</b>: Your plot should be visually appealing. You can use different matplotlib or seaborn styles to make your plot look good.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Functionality (5)</b>: You should draw a plot suitable the given data.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Completeness (10)</b>: Your plot should have a suitable title, axes labels, legend (if required) and all the other components that make a plot <b>complete</b>.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Insightfulness (10)</b>: You should give <b>at least one useful insight</b> that you can draw from the plot.</li>\n",
    "</ul><br>\n",
    "<b>Also note the following points</b>:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>You can use more than one dataset if you want to and also you can use only part of a dataset if you want to.</li>\n",
    "    <li>You will not be graded on what kind of dataset you chose. Feel free to chose any dataset you want.</li>\n",
    "    <li>You will not be graded on how complicated your plot is. A plot with a single line plot (if it deserves it) can get full points whereas a plot with many subplots can get less points (if it deserves it).</li>\n",
    "    <li>You will not be graded on your code but on your plot. So you are free to use a single line of seaborn code if you feel like it. This also means you can use functions or libraries not covered in the theory or exercise if you want.</li>\n",
